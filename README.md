# Java programming exercises
Some programming exercises in Java I did back in 2016 in preparation for
a job interview. I did a lot of commercial Java programming until 2012 but 
then moved into a management role without much development hands-on. Therefore
I did some exercises to get familiar with Java (and especially IntelliJ again).
